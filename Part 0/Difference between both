The main difference between both is that without SPA the webpage has to rerender again when the post method
is received by the server. The server do the req to the browser to rerender the webpage again in all the
Get request process (// HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

Otherwise, SPA executes the render of the file HTML, CSS and js ONCE. In the moment that User submit the form,
the DOM in the js file fetch the data, add it to the notes list, rerender ONLY the UL LIST and send the data to the server
with post method.
